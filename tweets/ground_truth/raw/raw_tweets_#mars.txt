Is there life on #Mars they ask! Drilling in the oceans simply isn't enough  we must drill in the #moon or demonstrate military might!
Morally wrong to be spending billions on #mars exploration while we're cutting services an support for sick and disabled.
If signs of life are found on the #Mars mission will that be a final nail in religions coffin?
