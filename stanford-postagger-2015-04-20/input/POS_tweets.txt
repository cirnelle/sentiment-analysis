#PlutoFacts: I wrote â€œThe Pluto Filesâ€ book http://t.co/10A4Dykg63 in recovery after years of hate-mail from school children.
#PlutoFacts: Was an accessory in the â€œdemotion" of Pluto. But I didnâ€™t pull the trigger. That was self-confessed @PlutoKiller
#PlutoFacts: @NewHorizons2015 went 4-billion miles to buzzcut Pluto by 120 000 miles. A hole-in-one on a 2-mile golf shot.
First rule of Science: Must Finish experiment before you die. @NewHorizons2015 was launched fast. Reached Pluto in 9 years.
#PlutoFacts: As reported in the @NYTimes in 1930  when discovered  Pluto was presumed to be the size of Earth.
#PlutoFacts: Pluto would fit comfortably between New York &amp; Dallas. Between Rome &amp; Moscow.  Between Perth &amp; Melbourne.
#PlutoFacts: The moons Ganymede Titan Callisto Europa Io Titan &amp; our Moon are all bigger than Pluto. Get over that one too.
#PlutoFacts: In the @Disney pantheon  Goofy wears clothes  is bipedal  owns a home. Pluto is butt naked  lives in a dog house

#PlutoFacts: In 1979  Pluto crossed Neptuneâ€™s orbit  and for 20 years was the eighth â€œplanetâ€ in the solar system.
#PlutoFacts Plutoâ€™s primary moon Charon is so large that their mutual center-of-mass lies not within Pluto but in empty space

At the (slow) rate the Moon is tidally locking Earth  the Sun will die before it succeeds â€” a more important concern for all.
Contrary to Pink Floyd's 1973 album-cover proclamation  there is no Dark Side of the Moon. A day there simply lasts a month.
Earth has already tidally locked the Moon  which is why it shows only one face to Earth - the â€œnearâ€ side.
The Moonâ€™s Motivation: Luna is desperately trying to slow Earthâ€™s rotation so that one Earth day eventually equals one Month.

Since 1972  after we discovered we keep better time than Earth does  weâ€™ve added 25 leap secs. Done only on June 30 &amp; Dec 31.
June 30th's leap second will manifest as an extra second in the last minute of the day  Greenwich time. ( 7h 59m 60s  PM  ET)
The Moon continually tugs on Earthâ€™s rotation  slowing us down bit by bit. To compensate  Tuesday  June 30 gets a leap second

Or maybe Cherubs are actually filled with Helium. But Helium wasnâ€™t discovered until 1868  long after most Cherubs were drawn
Okay. You want chubby babies to fly for real?  Give 'em ten foot (3-meter) wing-spans  like Condors  which weigh the same.

Curious fact that those who never fail are also those who never truly succeed.
For Algebra Geeks: If the thickness of a pizza is A  and its radius is Z  and pi is just PI  then its volume is V = PIZZA.
In other words  if the crust of a 14-inch pizza is 1-inch wide  then the next 1-inch band occupies 30% of the topping's area.
If the cheese on a 14-inch pizza falls just 1-inch shy of the crust  the pie is missing 30% of the cheese that could be there
A 14-inch pizza is 154 square inches of food.  Nearly twice as large as the 78 square inches of a 10-inch pie.
Odd that pizza is sold by the inch  but consumed by the square-inch. This fact confuses assessment of pricing and toppings.
In Math  dividing by zero is â€œundefined.â€ So why doesn't @JohnAllenPaulos define the thing so I can return to my calculations
Okay two more legit Alien IDs: If you are of Mercury you are Mercurial. And if you are of Jupiter  by jove  you are Jovian.
Last one: The Latinized name for Earth is Terra. If you are human "of the Earth" you are Terrable. (Just kidding  Earthlings)
Want More? The Moon's Latinized name is Luna.  If you are "of the Moonâ€ youre simply â€œLunarâ€.  Lunatics are something else..
Not that anybody asked  but the Sun's Latinized name is Sol.  If you are "of the Sun" you are simply â€œSolarâ€.
Venus is the Roman goddess of love &amp; sexuality. And so medical doctors assigned Venereal - â€œof Venusâ€ to all related diseases
Ceres is the Roman goddess of agriculture and grain crops  which indeed gives us our breakfast word Cereal --  "of Ceres".
Gotta give you that one @elakdawalla.  If youâ€™re from the Dwarf Planet Ceres  youâ€™d surely be Cereal. https://t.co/e5SiAycXvD
From Venus? Then youâ€™re Venusian. But the proper term is Venereal. Unfortunately Doctors nabbed it before Astrophysicists did
And it seems to me that any life forms we discover within Jupiterâ€™s icy moon Europa would rightly be called Europeans.
Seems to me  if we discover any life forms from the Vega star system (constellation Lyrae) they'd rightly be called Vegans.

The Bibleâ€™s best estimate for Pi:  3.0  (1 Kings 7:23)
The â€œPâ€ sound in the Greek letter Pi evokes â€œperipheryâ€.  Multiply any circle's diameter by Pi and you get its circumference.

GPS Satellites are pre-corrected for General Relativity  allowing them to beam us the accurate time for Earthâ€™s surface.
GPS satellites  located farther from Earthâ€™s center than we are  keep faster time than do our clocks on Earthâ€™s surface.
In #Interstellar: And in the real universe  strong gravitational fields measurably slow passage of time relative to others.
In #Interstellar: Thereâ€™s a robot named KIPP. One of the Executive Producers  a physicist  is named Kip. Iâ€™m just saying.

Got a bunch more Southern Hemisphere tidbits  but I think Iâ€™ll save them for even later...
So â€œAlpha" Centauri is the brightest star in the constellation Centaurus. And â€œBeta" Pictoris is the 2nd brightest in Pictor.
Apart from common names  stars are generally ID'ed in order of brightness within a constellation  using the Greek alphabet.
The Southern skies have the closest star system to the Sun - the famed â€œAlpha Centauriâ€  The 3rd brightest in the night sky.
Earth is closest to the Sun during the Southern Hemisphere Summer. For the North  that of course coincides with our winter.
Many big telescope in the North have twins in the South  giving astrophysicists coherent full-sky coverage of the Universe.
Just an FYI: Earthâ€™s South Magnetic Pole is actually in the North. Thatâ€™s why the North tip of a compass needle points there.
The center of the Milky Way â€” a target of study for my PhD â€” passes directly overhead for all middle southern latitudes.
â€œArctic" derives from Arktos  the Greek word for Bear. The Arctic's got em. (For now.) The Ant-Arctic doesn't.
Whatâ€™s the North Pole? Curl the fingers of your right hand in the direction of rotation. Stick out your thumb. Thatâ€™s North.

Good Morning Australia. Resuming my tweets intended for you and everyone else down under -- south of the Equator.
Hmm. I think Iâ€™ll take a break for 6 or 7 hours â€” until the Aussies wake up â€” then continue the Southern Hemisphere hijinks.
Sundials designed for the North won't work in the Southern Hemisphere. If ported there  they would reckon time backwards.
In the North  the shadow of a sundialâ€™s gnomon sweeps clockwise. Thatâ€™s  in fact  what defined clockwise in the first place.
Some of us in the North are jealous that 100% of the worldâ€™s population of free Penguins live in the Southern Hemisphere.
Earth is not only oblate â€” wider at the equator than pole-to-pole  but pear shaped â€” slightly wider just south of the equator
Earth's centrifugal force at the Equator renders everybody and everything about 6% lighter than theyâ€™d weigh at the poles.
At a revolution speed of 1 700 km / hour  the equator is Earthâ€™s fastest moving part. All other latitudes move more slowly.
I think it's cool that there's a country on the equator with the name "Equator". Better known in Spanish as Ecuador
Antarcticaâ€™s subglacial Lake Vostok is a body of water  trapped in ice  that hasnâ€™t seen air in at least 15-million years.
The flag in Antarctica that ID's the South Pole has to be repositioned  every year. The glacier beneath moves continuously.
The South Pole is covered with land: Antarctica. In the North  Santaâ€™s gotta live on an (ever-shrinking) slab of floating ice
At about 2800 meters above sea level  the South Pole plateau sits at an elevation almost as high as that of Mount Olympus.
Toilet Bowls drain however they're designed to circulate water.  Itâ€™s irrelevant whether you live above or below the equator.

Thereâ€™s a very large array of radio telescopes in New Mexico.  As seen in the film Contact. We call it the â€œVery Large Array"
Want More?  The far side of the Moon is called â€œThe Far Side of the Moon"
No other scientific field rivals astrophysics in the transparency of its lexicon.
The titanic explosion that birthed all of space  time  matter  and energy we call the â€œBig Bang"
The mile-wide crater in Arizona  made by a meteor  is called â€œMeteor Crater"
Jupiterâ€™s big red spot is called â€œJupiterâ€™s Red Spot"
Generally in the universe we name things in ways that minimize confusion.  e.g. Spots on the Sun are called â€œSun Spots"
Never knew why phobias are given long complicated names.  Afraid of today? Friday the 13th? You are Friggatriskadekaphobic.

At #AMillionWays party in Santa Fe  NM #Cosmos was invited  along with some friends of @SethMacFarlane http://t.co/XesK3OaUz1
Trivia: #AMillionWays filmed near Santa Fe  New Mexico at the same time as #Cosmos  enabling @SethMacFarlane to visit our set
The film #AMillionWays to Die in the West would be numerically accurate if named A Million Occasions to Utter the Word F%&amp;K
Apart from a badly oriented full moon  I give #AMillionWays an â€œAâ€ for its sweeping &amp; romantic portrayals of the night sky.
Was ready to count up to 1 000 000.  But #AMillionWays short-changed me. It showed only twenty-two ways to die in the west.
The block of ice portrayed in #AMillionWays would weigh about 2.5 tons. Enough to squash pretty much anything it fell on.

Lunar Eclipses are visible from the entire Earth hemisphere facing the Moon. Thatâ€™s billions &amp; billions of people  : - )
Those who don't know a Lunar Eclipse is in progress will likely mistake Earth's shadow for the Moon going through phases.
At 3.5 hrs  Total Lunar Eclipses are long &amp; boring. Wait for the Moon to enter the deepest part of Earth's shadow: 1:58am ET.
Total Eclipses occur every couple of years or so. If anyone calls them "rare"  ask if they feel that way about the Olympics.
Dust in Earth's atmosphere can tint sunlight  casting eclipsed Moons in a deep red light. But often the Moon just gets dark.
After midnight Monday ET  the Full Moon ambles deep into Earth's projected shadow in space: Behold a Total Lunar Eclipse.

You canâ€™t compress ice. If you try  it instantly liquefies to occupy less volume  as under the hi-pressure of a skate blade.
As anybody who freezes food knows  water becoming ice expands by about 10%. Also why 10% of an iceberg sits above the water.
Obscure Fact: Skating is possible only because compressed ice melts. So skaters glide on slippery water not on slippery ice.

Supersonic planes can fly east-west fast enough to reverse Sunsets  landing at a clock time earlier than when they took off.
Planes fly between 500 &amp; 650 mph  so east-west sunset flights don't freeze the Sun  but they beautifully prolong twilight.

That was three-weeks-worth of Tweets in one evening. Sorry to overload your Twitter streams. Good night universe.
Thought Experiment: Stand on a scale in an elevator. Cut the cable. You  the scale  and the elevator fall -- scale reads zero
Cool Experiment: Poke a hole anywhere in a paper cup of water. Drop cup. Water  while weightless in free fall  stops spewing.
Mysteries of #Gravity: Astronaut Clooney informs medical doctor Bullock what happens medically during oxygen deprivation.
An Orbit is a continual state of free fall  but while moving so fast sideways that the surface curves away at the same rate.
Fall towards Earth. Fall towards the Moon. Fall towards Mars. Fall towards anywhere at all  you'll be weightless in zero-G
Earth's gravity extends to infinity. To experience "zero-G" simply requires you move through space without rockets firing.
My Tweets hardly ever convey opinion. Mostly perspectives on the world. But if you must know  I enjoyed #Gravity very much.
FYI: Angular Momentum -- The tendency  once set rotating  to keep rotating  unless another force acts to slow or stop it.
Mysteries of #Gravity: Why we enjoy a SciFi film set in make-believe space more than we enjoy actual people set in real space
Mysteries of #Gravity: Satellite communications were disrupted at 230 mi up  but communications satellites orbit 100x higher.
Mysteries of #Gravity: Nearly all satellites orbit Earth west to east yet all satellite debris portrayed orbited east to west
Mysteries of #Gravity: Why Bullock's hair  in otherwise convincing zero-G scenes  did not float freely on her head.
Mysteries of #Gravity: Why anyone is impressed with a zero-G film 45 years after being impressed with "2001:A Space Odyssey"
Mysteries of #Gravity: When Clooney releases Bullock's tether  he drifts away. In zero-G a single tug brings them together.
Mysteries of #Gravity: How Hubble (350mi up) ISS (230mi up) &amp; a Chinese Space Station are all in sight lines of one another.
Mysteries of #Gravity:  Why Bullock  a medical Doctor  is servicing the Hubble Space Telescope.
The film #Gravity depicts a scenario of catastrophic satellite destruction that can actually happen.
The film #Gravity should be renamed "Angular Momentum"
